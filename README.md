Setup:


Copy code
pip install cookiecutter

Once cookiecutter is installed, you can use it to create a new project based on your template by running the following command:

Copy code
cookiecutter https://github.com/USERNAME/ml-project-template.git

You will be prompted to enter the values for the template variables defined in your cookiecutter.json file. Once you have entered the values and finished the prompts, cookiecutter will create a new directory for your project with the specified file structure and placeholders.
